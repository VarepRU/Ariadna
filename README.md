# Ariadna
## Description
Surely it happened to you that you dig diamonds for an hour and you almost never find them. It's simple, you got an unlucky line, if you had dug two blocks to the right, you would have found 3 times more! This mod tells you which line is best for you to dig to get the most diamonds. Ariadne will guide you through the depths of the world straight to the diamonds. All you have to do is just dig in a straight line.

## Configuration
It is highly recommended to install ModMenu for easy customization.
1. <ins>Radius of XZ dimensions(square)</ins> - radius in which Ariadna will search for diamonds, the starting point is the player himself, diamonds are searched in the direction of the player's gaze. So far, only north/south is supported. It is not recommended to set a value greater than your chunk loading. It's compatible with Bobby!
2. <ins>Y radius of area to scan</ins> - approximate radius of veins for the target block. Overestimating this values ​​may lead to lags!
3. <ins>Y layer where you are going to mine</ins> - this is the height at which your feet will be while digging.
4. <ins>Target block</ins> - Ariadna is designed to search for diamonds, but you can search for routes for any blocks.

## How to use
First of all, you need to drill to the Y height. After that, point camera to the north or south and press hotkey. Ariadna will scan this area and find the most profitable X line. After that, you need to dig along current Z to align with this X coordinate, then you can safely dig along the X line and loot your diamonds. When you dig forward as many blocks as you indicated in the scanning radius, press hotkey again and dig along the new X.

## Multiplayer
Since mod entirely client-side, you can use it on almost any server without problems. Mining with Ariadna is not as profitable as X-ray, but it's extremely safe. If moderator wants to check your logs, he will see regular straight tunnels that will not differ from tunnels of other players. No one will even be able to suspect that you are using this mod. I consulted with my friends, who manage servers and their opinions were divided, some believe that Ariadna is a cheat, others don't see anything illegal. Cheat or not cheat?
